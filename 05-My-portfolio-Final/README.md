# The second version of my portfolio

## I built a webpage titled "My Portfolio" following this structure:

#### Task #1
- [x] To include in the code the tags: 'main' 'header' 'section' 'footer'
#### Task #2
- [x] To create another page only with the section: About me. Using the 'article' tag. To include the initial navigation and footer in this page. To include 'About Me' in the navigation of the first page in such a way that it becomes a website with 2 pages with the same navigation menu and the links work between them.
#### Task #2.1
- [x] To include the first projects: 'Table with countries', 'Recipe', 'My Portfolio V1', 'Table in Table' in the portfolio (with image) which will be a link that opens the pages in a separate tab.
#### Task #3
- [x] To create an HTML page with nested tables. A 3x3 table with another 2x2 table in each cell, and in each cell of that table a 1x1 table. Use the 'border' attribute for easier visualization.
#### Task #4
- [x] In the bottom right corner of the 'My Portfolio' page, place a 'back to top' button that will take you to the top of the page.
#### Task #5
- [x] In the contact section, integrate icons.
